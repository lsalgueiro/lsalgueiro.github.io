<p>In February, I found myself working a week in Stuttgart. This came on the tail end of an intense period of work and travel â€” and it was, in fact, the last one since, as by that time Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg already registered cases of COVID-19 and the country would soon go into lockdown.</p>

<p>This was recorded early in the morning, as the sun rose over the Oberer SchloÃŸgarten, between the Staatsoper and the Landtag. You hear one early-morning jogger and a smattering of distant chatter, but the soundscape is mostly dominated by the birds and other animals that nest and frolic around the Eckensee. The city had not yet awoken; this window records a slice of the gradual reintroduction of the human. And it is from this situation that the curious dramaturgy of the recording (which is unedited in its temporal unfolding) emerges: these two layers coexist not in the otherâ€™s negative space â€” nor is the human here drowning out the animal â€” but their utterances seem to cluster together in time.</p>

<p>This soundscape was recorded on a Zoom H2n with a Primo ECM172 omni microphone.</p>
