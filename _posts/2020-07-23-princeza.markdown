I flew back to Lisbon just in time to make it to the recording sessions of my reduction-slash-arrangement of Ruy Coelho's ballet, _A princeza dos sapatos de ferro_, commissioned and played four-handed by the always phenomenal Philippe Marques and Duarte Pereira Martins. The recording will be released in the duo's next album, alongside music from Stravinsky, Ravel and Fernando Lopes-Gra√ßa.

They posted a teaser in the run-up to their string of concerts and subsequent recording session:
