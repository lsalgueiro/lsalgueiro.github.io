# First fragments towards a preface

If the string quartet is “a conversation amongst four intelligent people”, as Goethe once remarked, _Wolf Town_ is a Mexican standoff.

The four parties are bound to each other, required to sustain a strategic tension that presents them no suitable exit strategy. Despite being ostensibly pitted against each other, any participant engaging in aggression would in fact guarantee their own demise.

The title is borrowed from a poem by the Canadian poet Anne Carson (_The Life of Towns_, from _Plainwater_, 1995), and hopefully retains some of the lingering dangerousness of her lines.

## Internal structure of parts

The piece employs quasi-proportional notation. (A more con- ventional notation — be it metrically notated or arranged in ac- cordance to a time grid — could almost be salvaged or intuited from the way it is here presented, but shouldn’t.)

The spatial arrangement thus provides clues to the temporal proportions of each gesture, as well as to the proportion be- tween different gestures.

The overall temporal unfolding of each gesture should be condi- tioned by the circumstances inherent to its physical production, such as dynamic level or pressure and resistance — as well as to the interaction between parts.

> The “blots” that accompany the notated pitches graphically trace the air pressure blown into the instrument over time (or the amount of energy to be input into the physical system that is the instrument). Because of the underlying physics of an wind instrument, this has the twofold function of depicting the dynamic level, but also the brightness or complexity of the timbre.
